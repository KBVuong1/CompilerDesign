Compiler Design2
===============
This course is about the design of [compilers](index.md) (hence the name). To participate, [master the pre-requisites first, or along the way](background.md). [Use git and github](git.md).

Contributions we will make:

- We [learning by doing](http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html), so we will build [a derivative-based parser combinator library in C](parser-combinator-project.md).
- We also [learn by teaching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching), so we will develop [open educational resources](open-educational-resources.md).

[Meet the professor](professor.md).
